# Dev Diary
> This file serves as a bit of a thought dump of each session I have while coding this project


## 16/04/2025 - Getting started

### Summary
- Downloaded PyCharm Community Edition & started figuring my way around it
- Created an `httpclients` module containing
  - a `BaseHttpClient` class to handle making `GET`/`POST`
  - some basic logging to refactor later into structured logs
  - some error handling around the `get` method

### Thoughts
